# httyd-place

I made this because I wanted multiple people to be able to update the template image. Do not change the dimensions in the image or the template script will break, just update it in place.

## HOW TO USE THE TEMPLATE AND SCRIPT ON /r/place
Our friends at r/osuplace have made an overlay script! Use this to make sure you're placing pixels in the right spot.
